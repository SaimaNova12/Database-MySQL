## Database-MySQL
#### MySQL queries are commands that we use to interact with a MySQL database. These queries allow us to perform various operations such as retrieving data, updating records, inserting new data, and deleting records. MySQL uses a Structured Query Language (SQL) for communication, and its queries are written in SQL syntax.
#### Example of some of the MySQL queries I have worked with:
- **SELECT Queries**
- **INSERT Queries**
- **UPDATE Queries**
- **DELETE Queries**
- **CREATE TABLE Queries**
- **ALTER TABLE Queries**
- **DROP TABLE Queries**
- **JOIN Queries**
- **GROUP BY Queries**
- **ORDER BY Queries**
- **Distinct Queries**
- **Truncate Queries**
