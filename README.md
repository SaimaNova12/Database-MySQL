### Database-MySQL
#### MySQL queries are commands that you use to interact with a MySQL database. These queries allow you to perform various operations such as retrieving data, updating records, inserting new data, and deleting records. MySQL uses a Structured Query Language (SQL) for communication, and its queries are written in SQL syntax.
Here are some common types of MySQL queries I have worked with:
- SELECT Queries
- INSERT Queries
- UPDATE Queries
- DELETE Queries
- CREATE TABLE Queries
- ALTER TABLE Queries
- DROP TABLE Queries
- JOIN Queries
- GROUP BY Queries
- ORDER BY Queries
- Distinct Queries
- Truncate Queries
